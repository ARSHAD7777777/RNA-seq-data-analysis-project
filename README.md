In this project, we will look at the changes in gene expression in Phaeodactylum tricornutum depending on the nutrient availability in the environment.
This is done by using data from RNA-seq. The data is pre-processed and analyzed in R using EdgeR, Bioconductor, and Limma to draw insights into various genes' fold changes.
