In this project, we will look at the changes in gene expression in Phaeodactylum tricornutum de-
pending on the nutrient availability in the environment. More specifically, the phosphorous nutrient
availability. P. tricornutum is a diatom and often serves as a model system for marine microalgae.
One of the macronutrients needed to sustain the growth of marine algae populations is phosphor--
ous (P). In biological molecules, P is often represented in the form of covalent-bound phosphate
(PO3âˆ’4 ). However, inorganic phosphate (Pi) is also present in the cytosol due to transport form
the extracellular space, or due to degradation of certain P-containing biomolecules. Nucleoside
triphosphates (e.g. ATP), nucleic acid (DNA or RNA), and membrane lipids (e.g. phospholipids)
are all biomolecular sources of P. The mentioned sources of P are of course vital for all life on Earth,
meaning that there must be tight regulations for P uptake and management within living cells.
Some of the proteins that regulate this are Pi transporters, phosphatases, and phospholipases.
The former are proteins that transport Pi across membranes. Phosphatases and phospholipases
are both groups of enzymes that make P more accessible for the synthesis of new compounds, by
cleaving covalent bonds in P-containing biomolecules
